\section*{Abstract}	
 In this paper I am going to compare two confidential cloud services, the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) and Nimble. They both provide the requirements of the CIA triad that are confidentiality, integrity and high availability via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and own mechanisms. Especially when it comes to integrity, they both differ from each other. While CCF does not have a protection against rollback attacks and is therefore vulnerable for them, Nimble is specialized on detecting and protecting that kind of attacks. Nimble has also the requirement of keeping the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) as small as possible. This paper shows that both systems have advantages and disadvantages. In comparison with CCF, the TCB of nimble is much more smaller and therefore less vulnerable. CCF, on the other hand, has better performance than Nimble, what is also an important aspect of cloud services. Both systems trust the TEEs and assume that they cannot get compromised, which is a huge problem in the current development of TEEs. Another aspect they both ignore, are other attacks like forking attacks, side channel attacks or physical attacks. Accordingly, both systems have good approaches of different subareas that are all very important for cloud computing, but nevertheless harbor high risks for applications with high requirements of security.\\
