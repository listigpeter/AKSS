\section*{Abstract}	
 In this paper I am going to compare two confidential cloud services, the Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) and Nimble. They both fulfill the requirements of the CIA triad which are confidentiality, integrity and high availability via Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and their own mechanisms. Especially when it comes to integrity, they both differ from each other. While CCF does not have protection against rollback attacks and is therefore vulnerable for them, Nimble specializes on detecting and protecting that kind of attack. Nimble also has the feature of keeping the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) as small as possible. This paper shows that both systems have strengths and weaknesses. In comparison with CCF, the TCB of Nimble is much smaller and therefore less vulnerable. CCF, on the other hand, has better performance than Nimble, which is also an important aspect of cloud services. Both systems trust the TEEs and assume that they cannot get compromised, which is a huge problem in the current development of TEEs. Another aspect they both ignore, is other attacks like forking attacks, side-channel attacks or physical attacks. Accordingly, both systems have good approaches in different subareas that are all very important for cloud computing, but nevertheless harbor high risks for applications with high requirements of security.\\
