\section{Introduction}
	A Confidential Cloud Service is an additional service that can be applied on top of an existing cloud provider \cite{confidentiality}. These confidential services are needed, if properties have requirements of safety, which cannot be guaranteed by a normal cloud provider.   \\
	 The CIA triad,  shown in Figure \ref{cia},  describes three important requirements of information security \cite{ciaBook} \cite{cia}. It contains data Confidentiality, Integrity Protection and High Availability.\\
	  Data confidentiality is keeping the data private, which is very important especially for cloud providers. Challenges are encrypting the data and protecting the keys.\\
	   Integrity protection is introduced as a requirement for data confidentiality. It is the insurance of complete and correct code that is not changed by a bad party. But these two characteristics are hard to implement although they are mandatory for cloud computing. This is, because in cloud computing the trusted computing base (TCB) gets bigger and also includes the cloud providers, so applications in the field of finances, medicine or governmental issues cannot afford to trust this whole TCB.\\
	    High availability is required by the fact that people rely on the systems that are on the cloud. So they should work, even if failures occur.\\
