These days more and more applications are stored in the cloud, because it is faster and more flexible. %TODO: check advantages of cloud
 But over the time more and more cloud providers get hacked or data is stolen, because providers did not encrypt this data. This is the reason why secure applications in the field of finances or health cannot afford this risk with storing their applications on the cloud. To make the cloud infrastructure more reliable even for such secure fields Confidential Cloud Services are implemented. It started with simple key-value stored services until it now is designed with the help of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). \\
 A Confidential Cloud Service is an additional service that can be applied on top of an existing cloud provider~\cite{confidentiality}. These confidential services are needed, if properties have requirements of safety, which cannot be guaranteed by a normal cloud provider.   \\
 The CIA triad,  shown in Figure~\ref{cia},  describes three important requirements of information security~\cite{ciaBook, cia}. It contains data Confidentiality, Integrity Protection and High Availability.\\
 Data confidentiality is keeping the data private, which is very important especially for cloud providers. Challenges are encrypting the data and protecting the keys.\\
 Integrity protection is introduced as a requirement for data confidentiality. It is the insurance of complete and correct code that is not changed by a bad party. But these two characteristics are hard to implement although they are mandatory for cloud computing. This is, because in cloud computing the trusted computing base (TCB) gets bigger and also includes the cloud providers and their infrastructure, so applications in the field of finances, medicine or governmental issues cannot afford to trust this whole TCB.\\
 High availability is required by the fact that people rely on the systems that are on the cloud. So they should work, even if failures occur.\\
