\section{Rollback Protection}
As mentioned before, CCF only provides rollback protection for its nodes. They cannot be rolled back, because a node can never restart in CCF, but has to enter as a complete new node. That means, a node can possibly be killed, but never cause a rollback attack on the system. In contrast, the ledger can be rolled back, because it is stored in the persistent storage outside the Trusted Execution Environment and CCF does not provide an additional mechanism to detect rollback attacks. This makes CCF vulnerable and a risk for application with high requirements of security.\\
 Nimble, on the other hand, has an extended protection against these attacks. To protect rollback attacks they firstly must be detected. Therefore Nimble presents three categories of rollback attacks:
	\subsubsection*{Stale responses:} Stale responses happen when old data is given by the host although there is already newer data. Therefore Nimble uses an linearizable append-only ledger. Linearizability is a criteria that provides strong consistency and is realized via the endorsers.\\
	 Remember that an endorser only stores the tail of the ledger, so if data is read from the ledger it can be compared with the endorser. In case it is not the same, a rollback attack did happen or the system failed before the endorser could store the tail of the hash chain. Accordingly, the ledger cannot be rolled back, because the state is provided by the endorser, which does not have a previous state to roll back to. 
	\subsubsection*{Synthesized requests:} Synthesized requests means that the provider sends requests that are not sent by the application and stores them. This is handled via signing. The application signs the state and then appends it on the ledger. When the application reads a state from the ledger it then can recognize whether it is a real state with a signature or a synthesized request from a malicious provider.
	\subsubsection*{Replay:} When a provider applies older requests to the storage this is called replay. Therefore the position of the stored state in the ledger is also stored with a signature. So the application can check, if this signed position matches with the position it is currently stored in the ledger.\\
