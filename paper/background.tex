\section{Background}
Before I start with an example of a confidential cloud service some definitions must be clear to understand the following parts.
\subsection{Trusted Execution Environments}
A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a hardware based component where critical an be runned inside a part called Enclave. The code inside this Enclave is hard to modify by malicious parties and can thus be trusted more and is therefore often be used for confidential computing.  But of course it is not impossible to change code inside a TEE, so this eventualities should also be ekpt in mind.
\subsection{Rollback Attacks}
There exist many different attacks for cloud services like forking attacks, side channel attacks or rollback attacks. These are all important attacks that should be protected by a confidential cloud service, but in this paper I will focus on rollback attacks.\\
In this attack malicious parties safe an older version of the system and apply this older version. So they "roll back" the state of the system. This can be useful for guessing encryption keys. For keys there often exist some limitations of guesses, so the key cannot get brute forced. The problem is with rolling back the state of the system a malicious member can go back to the state before the first try and try guessing again. So brute forcing the encryption key is still possible by using these attacks.
